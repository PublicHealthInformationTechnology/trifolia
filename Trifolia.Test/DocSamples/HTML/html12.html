<p>Much of the initial development of this guide was driven by a pilot project in July 2007. The pilot project used object identifiers (OIDs) assigned to a fictional facility and vendor to illustrate the numbering schemes for which facilities and vendors are responsible.</p>
<p>Except for the example patient identifiers, the example code in this document and the accompanying sample files use these pilot OIDs. Example patient identifiers use the HL7 example OID. In practice, the identifiers will be assigned by facilities and software applications submitting reports to NHSN.</p>
<p>These pilot instance identifiers begin with <span class="XMLName">2.16.840.1.113883.3.117.1.1.5</span>; HL7 example identifiers begin with <span class="XMLName">2.16.840.1.113883.19.5</span>. They are used throughout this guide and are documented in the appendix on <a href="#/volume1#section46">Example Instance Identifiers (Non-normative)</a>.</p>
