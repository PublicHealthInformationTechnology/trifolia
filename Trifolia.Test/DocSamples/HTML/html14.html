<p>The terms <em>optional</em> and <em>required</em> describe the <em>lower</em> bound of cardinality as follows:</p>
<p><em>Optional</em> means that the <span class="XMLName">number</span> of allowable occurrences of an element may be 0; the cardinality will be expressed as [0..1] or [0..*] or similar. In these cases, the element may not be present in the instance. </p>
<p><em>Required</em> means that the <div class="XMLName"><span>number</span></div> of allowable occurrences of an element must be at least 1; the cardinality will be expressed as [m..n] where m &gt;=1 and n &gt;=1 for example [1..1] or [1..*]. In these cases, the element must be present in the instance. If an element is required, but is not known (and would otherwise be omitted if it were optional), it must be represented by a null flavor.
