<p>This section, Overview, provides an overview of Clinical Document Architecture (CDA), recent changes to the standard, and information on how to understand and use the CDA templates provided in the Templates section.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>CDA R2 Background/Templated CDA/Background/Current Release/Future Work/Change Notification Process</strong>. These sections contain selected background material on the CDA Release 2 (CDA R2) base standard to aid the reader in conceptualizing the “templated CDA” approach to implementation guide development.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Design Considerations/Rendering Header Information for Human Presentation/Unknown and No Known Information/Negating Clinical Statements.</strong> These sections include design considerations and overarching principles that have been developed and applied across the CDA templates in this guide. Material in these sections can be thought of as “heuristics”, as opposed to the formal and testable constraints found in the Templates section of this guide.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Using This Implementation Guide/Levels of Constraint/Conformance Conventions/XML Conventions Used in This Guide/Supporting Tools.</strong> This section describes the rules and formalisms used to constrain the CDA R2 standard. It describes the formal representation of CDA templates, the mechanism by which templates are bound to vocabulary, and additional information necessary to understand and correctly implement the normative content found in the Templates section of this guide.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>References.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Appendices</strong>. The Appendices include a list of acronyms and abbreviations, a high-level change log for this and all previous releases, a list of codes used by HAI reports, a list of Consolidated CDA (C-CDA) templates to which HAI templates conform, example instance identifiers, and vocabulary heuristics for code systems and value sets.</p>
