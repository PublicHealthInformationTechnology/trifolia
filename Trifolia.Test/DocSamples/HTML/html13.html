<p>The CDA standard describes conformance requirements in terms of three general levels corresponding to three different, incremental types of conformance statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1 requirements impose constraints upon the CDA Header. The body of a Level 1 document may be XML or an alternate allowed format. If XML, it must be CDA-conformant markup.</li>
<li>Level 2 requirements specify constraints at the section level of a CDA XML document: most critically, the section code and the cardinality of the sections themselves, whether optional or required.</li>
<li>Level 3 requirements specify constraints at the entry level within a section. A specification is considered “Level 3” if it requires any entry-level templates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these levels are rough indications of what a recipient can expect in terms of machine-processable coding and content reuse. They do not reflect the level or type of clinical content, and many additional levels of reusability could be defined.</p>
<p>The section libraries for each document type list the required and optional sections.</p>
