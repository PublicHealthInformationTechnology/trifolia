<p>This implementation guide uses the *HL7 Clinical Document Architecture, Release 2.0 (CDA R2) *as its base standard. CDA R2 is “… a document markup standard that specifies the structure and semantics of ‘clinical documents’ for the purpose of exchange” [CDA R2, Section 1.1]<sup>1</sup>. Clinical documents, according to CDA, have the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Persistence</li>
<li>Stewardship</li>
<li>Potential for authentication</li>
<li>Context</li>
<li>Wholeness</li>
<li>Human readability</li>
</ul>
<p>CDA defines a header for classification and management and a document body that carries the clinical record. While the header metadata are prescriptive and designed for consistency across all instances, the body is highly generic, leaving the designation of semantic requirements to implementation.</p>
