<p>CDA R2 can be constrained by mechanisms defined in the “Refinement and Localization” section of the <em>HL7 Version 3 Interoperability Standards<sup>2</sup></em>. The mechanism most commonly used to constrain CDA is referred to as “templated CDA”. In this approach, a library is created containing modular CDA templates such that the templates can be reused across any number of CDA document types, as shown in the following figure.</p>
<p><img src="/api/ImplementationGuide/3311/Image/TemplatedCDA.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Many different kinds of templates may be created. Among them, the most common are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Document-level templates:</strong> These templates constrain fields in the CDA header, and define containment relationships to CDA sections. For example, a History-and-Physical document-level template might require that the patient’s name be present, and that the document contain a Physical Exam section.</li>
<li><strong>Section-level templates:</strong> These templates constrain fields in the CDA section, and define containment relationships to CDA entries. For example, a Physical Exam section-level template might require that the section/code be fixed to a particular LOINC code, and that the section contain a Systolic Blood Pressure observation.</li>
<li><strong>Entry-level templates:</strong> These templates constrain the CDA clinical statement model in accordance with real world observations and acts. For example, a Systolic Blood Pressure entry-level template defines how the CDA Observation class is constrained (how to populate observation/code, how to populate observation/value, etc.) to represent the notion of a systolic blood pressure.</li>
</ul>
<p>A CDA implementation guide (such as this one) includes reference to those templates that are applicable. On the implementation side, a CDA instance populates the template identifier (templateId) field to assert conformance to a given template. On the receiving side, the recipient can not only test the instance for conformance against the CDA XML (Extensible Markup Language) schema, but can also test the instance for conformance against asserted templates.</p>
<p>Template identifiers are critical to the validation methods chosen for submissions to the NHSN. NHSN may reject as nonconformant instances that do not conform to the template identifier constraints defined here.</p>
